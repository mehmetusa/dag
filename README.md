# Does the solution work for larger graphs? 

However, it's worth noting that the performance of the solution may depend on the specific characteristics of the graph, such as its density and structure. In general, directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) tend to have more efficient algorithms for certain operations compared to general graphs due to their acyclic nature.

For very large graphs, the efficiency of the solution may also depend on the available memory and hardware resources. In some cases, optimizations or alternative algorithms may be necessary to handle extremely large graphs efficiently.

Overall, the provided solution is suitable for a wide range of graph sizes and should work well for many practical scenarios. If you encounter performance issues with particularly large graphs, you may consider optimizing the solution or exploring alternative algorithms tailored to your specific requirements.

# Unusual cases that aren't handled

The provided solution assumes that the input graph is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). It will not produce correct results if the input graph contains cycles. Here are some cases that are not handled:

Graph with cycles: If the input graph contains cycles, the topological sorting algorithm used in the solution will not work correctly. As a result, the longest path calculation may produce incorrect results or encounter an infinite loop.

Disconnected graph: If the input graph is disconnected, meaning there are vertices that are not reachable from the starting vertex, those vertices will not be considered in the longest path calculation.

Negative edge weights: If the edges of the graph have negative weights, the solution may not produce correct results, as it assumes that the longest path involves maximizing the number of edges traversed.
